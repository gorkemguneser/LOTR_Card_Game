# WELCOME TO THE LORD OF THE RINGS CARD GAME

## RULES:

From a deck of 50 unique cards, 25 cards will be distributed to players randomly.
Players can't have the same card in their hands/decks, however they can have same cards between their hands. The reason is that to balance the power.
Each player starts the game with 7 cards in their hands and 18 cards in their decks.
Every round, players place a card onto the field respectively.
End of each round, power difference between the cards will be deducted from defeated player's total health.
End of each round, players will pull a new card from their deck.
Game lasts 7 rounds. At the end of the seven round, player with more healths wins the game.
Before rounds end, if any player's health reduces the zero or below, that player lost.

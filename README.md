# WELCOME TO THE LORD OF THE RINGS CARD GAME

# RULES:

# From a deck of 50 unique cards, 25 cards will be distributed to players randomly.
# Players can't have the same card in their hands/decks, however they can have same cards between their hands. The reason is that to balance the power.
# Each player starts the game with 7 cards in their hands and 18 cards in their decks.
# Every round, players place a card onto the field respectively.
# End of each round, power difference between the cards will be deducted from defeated player's total health.
# End of each round, players will pull a new card from their deck.
# Game lasts 7 rounds. At the end of the seven round, player with more healths wins the game.
# Before rounds end, if any player's health reduces the zero or below, that player lost.

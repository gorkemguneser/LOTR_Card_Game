## Project Description

While learning basics of Python, this game is my first project to practice my learnings -especially functions

## Rules
From a deck of 50 unique cards, 25 cards will be distributed to players randomly.

Players can't have the same card in their hands/decks, however they can have same cards between their hands. The reason is that to balance the power.

Each player starts the game with 7 cards in their hands and 18 cards in their decks.

Every round, players place a card onto the field respectively.

End of each round, power difference between the cards will be deducted from defeated player's total health.

End of each round, players will pull a new card from their deck.

Game lasts 7 rounds. At the end of the seven round, player with more healths wins the game.

Before rounds end, if any player's health reduces the zero or below, that player lost.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?
1) I have created a Kanban Board on Trello to plan my schedule.
2) Before starting to code, I have written a pseudocode by using google docs to visualize each step about the game.
3) Afterwards, I have started to code the game on my local repository.
4) When development of the game is completed, testing process has been started. In this part, I have checked possible improvements and also tried to shorten my code.
5) When everything is completed, I have created .gitignore, as well as README.md file.
6) Last step is the preparation of the presentation.

## Organization
Each and every step of my process was structured on Kanban Board on Trello before I start coding. It makes things much faster and efficient for me once I combined it with pseudocode.

This repository includes;
1) LOTR_Card_Game.ipynb
2) .gitignore 
3) README.md


## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
